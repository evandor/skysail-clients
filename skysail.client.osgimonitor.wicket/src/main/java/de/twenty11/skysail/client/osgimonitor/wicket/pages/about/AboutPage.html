				What is it ---------- skysail <i>osgimonitor minimal</i> is a simple
				viewer for the installed bundles in an OSGi enviroment. In this
				state of development, it is not much more than a collection of
				bundles with a rather straight-forward setup, mostly suited for an
				non-trivial, introduction-style tutorial about OSGi. skysail
				osgimonitor further serves as a proof-of-concept for the skysail
				project (see links below). How to start it --------------- * Extract
				the zip file somewhere on your disk * Navigate on the command line
				to the bin folder * Depending on your OS, start either run.bat or
				run.sh (on linx chmod 775 first) * You should see an (equinox) OSGi
				prompt, and the framework should start downloading the necessary
				bundles. * You can monitor the progress by typing "ss" for short
				status and should see a growing list of bundles * When the framework
				is started, point your browser to http://localhost:port. The port to
				use is the one configured in conf/skysail.properties; there you will
				find the password as well. Configuration ------------- In the conf
				folder, there is a properties file which you can edit (setting the
				port and the [still very simple] user management properties. File
				Layout ----------- * bin: This is where the scripts (for starting)
				reside * conf: Adjust the port and the like * doc: Some more
				information * osgiRuntime: This is where the bundles get installed
